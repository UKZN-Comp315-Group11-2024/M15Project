Project M15/M15.exe

-------------------------------------------------

## ABOUT:

**M15** is an immersive C++ windows forms quiz app about the world of espionage. The app's aim is to give a fun experience and to teach you a thing a two about being a world class spy. The quiz consists of four main levels, each with a series of ten questions, and four bonus levels. Most of the questions are based on general knowledge of spies and the history of spying. Each level is timed, and progressing in the levels increases the difficulty of the gameplay. No hints are available; spies should be able to think on their feet. The quiz also has a leaderboard feature, a tutorial to help navigate the controls and actions, and it comes with neat facial recognition software.
